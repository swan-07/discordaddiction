# Inspiration

i spend 25 hours/day on discord which leaves me with little time to study and read papers for research :,( i made this project so that i could study while also getting dopamine from discord

# What it does

you can upload a pdf into the website, and my website will reformat it to look like discord texts

# How we built it

the website is built with vanilla html/css/js and hosted in vercel

# Challenges we ran into

i initially wanted to do a hardware project, and i spent the first 5 hours of the hackathon doing a different project when my hardware failed on me :( so i pivoted to this project with only a few hours left, because it was something i had wanted to create but never had the chance to before. one issue i faced was that headers (ex. Part 1: Apples) can't be treated like normal text and i had to find a way to separate them (using text size and bolding) to have paragraphs make sense

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

im pretty proud that i got my project up and running and looking pretty good after pivoting from my initial idea of a hardware project

# What we learned

i learned how to wrangle text in pdfs and display and work with websites :)

# What's next for our project

it would be nice to have a "library" or a way to save/download chats so that you can look back on them and don't have to recreate it every time
